Here is a dataset with the following columns:

Age
Years spent receiving their education
Income divided by 10,000
Number of visits to the doctor in the previous year
Part 1: Use the first three columns to predict the number of doctors visits with a linear regression model. 

Part 2: Build a linear model that only takes age and education years as the input; then a linear model that takes just the age and the income. Which model fits the data better? Graph data with both of those regression lines using pylab or matplotlib to visualize the results.

Part 3: Check that the two linear models from Part 2 and the linear model from Part 1 predict different values for the number of visits given some test data. Is the variation in the predictions consistent with the intuition?
